				The official website of Bridge Duel. I would mention the platform of the game but I am genuinely not sure if I am legally allowed to say that... [REDACTED] might come after me!

				<br /><br />

				I actually have permission to edit the Bridge Duel website, so this is sort of self promotion, but I think that is fine since that website has a totally different purpose than this one. Additionally, I spent a lot of time on the <a href="https://wiki.bridgeduel.xyz/wiki/index.php/Main_Page">wiki</a>! Maybe you could check it out.

				<br /><br />

				An interesting yap about how to write code that other people will understand. Conclusion: it is impossible.

				They also talk about when in the coding process one should write tests. Personally, I do not have to worry about this since I just do not write tests <em>ever</em>! (Kidding. Well, I try, but sometimes I do not bother.)
