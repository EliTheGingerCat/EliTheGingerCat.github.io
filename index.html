		<h1>Introduction</h1>
		<p>Hi, I like cats.</p>

		<h1>Cool Webpages</h1>

				Talks about AI and stuff. At the time of writing, only goes up to part 2.

				The official website of Bridge Duel. I would mention the platform of the game but I am genuinely not sure if I am legally allowed to say that... [REDACTED] might come after me!

				<br /><br />

				I actually have permission to edit the Bridge Duel website, so this is sort of self promotion, but I think that is fine since that website has a totally different purpose than this one. Additionally, I spent a lot of time on the <a href="https://wiki.bridgeduel.xyz/wiki/index.php/Main_Page">wiki</a>! Maybe you could check it out.

				<br /><br />

				An interesting yap about how to write code that other people will understand. Conclusion: it is impossible.

				<br /><br />

				They also talk about when in the coding process one should write tests. Personally, I do not have to worry about this since I just do not write tests <em>ever</em>! (Kidding. Well, I try, but sometimes I do not bother.)

				<br /><br />

				This is the reason I added these section, Cool Webpages, to this website, so I feel like it should also have its own entry.

				<br /><br />

				Quote from Con's website:

				<h2>My First Game</h2>

				Game on Roblox: <a href="https://www.roblox.com/games/8515170099">https://www.roblox.com/games/8515170099</a>
				
				<br /><br />

				A story game where you go on a trip but stuff goes wrong (shocking!).

				<h2>Ethical_Eli Hub</h2>
				Source code on GitHub: <a href="https://github.com/EliTheGingerCat/ethical-eli-hub">https://github.com/EliTheGingerCat/ethical-eli-hub</a><br />
				Game on Roblox: <a href="https://www.roblox.com/games/2174833639/Ethical-Eli-Hub">https://www.roblox.com/games/2174833639/Ethical-Eli-Hub</a>

				<br /><br />

				A Roblox game showcasing my Roblox games.

				<br /><br />
				
				No, not my <em>other</em> Roblox games. I intentionally said left out the word <q>other</q> in <q>showcasing my Roblox games</q> since this game is also showcased in itself. Crazy, right?

				<br /><br />

				As this projects section grows, it may seem redundant to maintain this hub, but since this game is in Roblox, it has the ability to teleport you to other Roblox games. Something like this might be possible on this website since I think it is possible to link a game in such a way that it automatically opens the Roblox application, but that is still not as cool as teleporting in the game. In the future I may even add integration across all my games that allows for teleporting to any game by me from any game by me. Is not that cool!?

				<br /><br />

				This website is also important though since it would be annoying to have to play a Roblox game every time one wants to read about my projects. Furthermore, I am not censored here; I can mention my stuff on GitHub! On Roblox, I am pretty sure this would violate the rule against directing users off-platform.

				<h2>Piggy Test</h2>
				Source code is unavailable.<br />
				Game on Roblox: <a href="https://www.roblox.com/games/8019282661">https://www.roblox.com/games/8019282661</a>

				<br /><br />
				
				A <a href="https://www.roblox.com/games/4623386862">Piggy</a> clone made by following an <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLsbxI7NIoTtgnU5Wx8SLN0xTpKuRrSDFF">AlvinBlox tutorial</a>.

				Honestly, this game will probably be replaced with something else at some point since it is not really my game. For that same reason, this game will not be made open source since <a href="https://www.youtube.com/alvinblox">AlvinBlox</a> provides the finished product to those who pay membership to his YouTube channel, so I am pretty sure he would not want people distributing a complete version for free, even if it was created by following the free tutorial. Interestingly, the playlist is now unlisted, though I think it is fine for me to share the link here.
