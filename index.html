		<h1>Introduction</h1>

		<p>Hi, I like cats.</p>
		
		<p>I am a religious <a href="https://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/776104/jewish/FAQ.htm">Khabad</a> Jew.</p>

		One can email me at: <a href="mailto:elithegingercat@gmail.com">elithegingercat@gmail.com</a>

		<h1>Cool Webpages</h1>
		<ul>
			<li><p>
				<a href="https://dayssincelastjsframework.com/">https://dayssincelastjsframework.com/</a>
				<br /><br />

				Displays the amount of days since the last JavaScript framework was released.
			</p></li>
			<li><p>
				<a href="https://aisafety.dance/">https://aisafety.dance/</a>
				<br /><br />

				Talks about AI and stuff. At the time of writing, only goes up to part 2.

				<a href="https://bridgeduel.xyz/">https://bridgeduel.xyz/</a>
				<br /><br />

				The official website of Bridge Duel. I would mention the platform of the game but I am genuinely not sure if I am legally allowed to say that... [REDACTED] might come after me!

				<br /><br />

				I actually have permission to edit the Bridge Duel website, so this is sort of self promotion, but I think that is fine since that website has a totally different purpose than this one. Additionally, I spent a lot of time on the <a href="https://wiki.bridgeduel.xyz/wiki/index.php/Main_Page">wiki</a>! Maybe you could check it out.

				<a href="https://github.com/johnousterhout/aposd-vs-clean-code">https://github.com/johnousterhout/aposd-vs-clean-code</a>
				<br /><br />

				An interesting yap about how to write code that other people will understand. Conclusion: it is impossible.

				<br /><br />

				They also talk about when in the coding process one should write tests. Personally, I do not have to worry about this since I just do not write tests <em>ever</em>! (Kidding. Well, I try, but sometimes I do not bother.)

				<a href="https://concon.soy/links">https://concon.soy/links</a>
				<br /><br />

				This is the reason I added these section, Cool Webpages, to this website, so I feel like it should also have its own entry.

				<br /><br />

				Quote from Con's website:

				<a href="https://mywiki.wooledge.org/">https://mywiki.wooledge.org/</a>
				<br /><br />

				This is a cool wiki with some interesting programming information.

				<br /><br />

				How I got here:

				<ol>
					<li><p>Saw XY Problem be brought up in an online chat.</p></li>
					<li><p>Someone posted a link to the commonly used page.</p></li>
					<li><p>I have already read about it before, but sometimes I feel like reading webpages I already read.</p></li>
					<li><p>Click the link: <a href="https://xyproblem.info/">https://xyproblem.info/</a></p></li>
					<li><p>Scroll to bottom.</p></li>
					<li><p>Click <q>Source 2</q>: <a href="https://mywiki.wooledge.org/XyProblem">https://mywiki.wooledge.org/XyProblem</a></p></li>
					<li><p>At this point, I am already on the website.</p></li>
					<li><p>Click the logo in the top left, presumably to go to the homepage: <a href="https://mywiki.wooledge.org/EnglishFrontPage">https://mywiki.wooledge.org/EnglishFrontPage</a></p></li>
					<li><p><q>The official front page URLs are <a href="https://mywiki.wooledge.org/">https://mywiki.wooledge.org/</a> or <a href="http://mywiki.wooledge.org/">http://mywiki.wooledge.org/</a> .</q></p></li>
				</ol>

				<a href="https://halachayomit.co.il/en/Default.aspx">https://halachayomit.co.il/en/Default.aspx</a>

				<br /><br />

				An interesting website with lots of halakha (Jewish law) regarding all kinds of topics.

				<br /><br />

				How I got here:
				<ol>
					<li><p>Saw people rinse their fingertips after the meal. Curious.</p></li>
					<li><p>Years later, saw it again, different people this time. They referred to it as "<span dir="rtl">מים אחרונים</span>" (mayim akhronim).</p></li>
					<li><p>Decided to search it up.</p></li>
					<li><p>Click search result: <a href="https://halachayomit.co.il/en/default.aspx?HalachaID=4058">https://halachayomit.co.il/en/default.aspx?HalachaID=4058</a></p></li>
					<li><p>Read the article.</p></li>
					<li><p>That was a good article.</p></li>
					<li><p>Scroll to botton.</p></li>
					<li><p>Additional Pages > Home Page</p></li>

				<a href="https://lifemap.cnrs.fr/">https://lifemap.cnrs.fr/</a>

				<br /><br />

				A massive phylogenic tree containing all known species (at least, according to this website).

				<br /><br />

				I think it would be cool to make a game out of this website: given a species name and perhaps some hints about what it looks like, or even an image of it, find exactly where the species is on the tree. I think this would be sort of like the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Wiki_Game">Wikipedia game</a>.

				Game on Roblox: <a href="https://www.roblox.com/games/2174833639/Ethical-Eli-Hub">https://www.roblox.com/games/2174833639/Ethical-Eli-Hub</a>

				<br /><br />

				A Roblox game showcasing my Roblox games.

				<br /><br />
				
				No, not my <em>other</em> Roblox games. I intentionally said left out the word <q>other</q> in <q>showcasing my Roblox games</q> since this game is also showcased in itself. Crazy, right?

				<br /><br />

				As this projects section grows, it may seem redundant to maintain this hub, but since this game is in Roblox, it has the ability to teleport you to other Roblox games. Something like this might be possible on this website since I think it is possible to link a game in such a way that it automatically opens the Roblox application, but that is still not as cool as teleporting in the game. In the future I may even add integration across all my games that allows for teleporting to any game by me from any game by me. Is not that cool!?

				<br /><br />

				This website is also important though since it would be annoying to have to play a Roblox game every time one wants to read about my projects. Furthermore, I am not censored here; I can mention my stuff on GitHub! On Roblox, I am pretty sure this would violate the rule against directing users off-platform.

				<h2>Piggy Test</h2>
				Source code is unavailable.<br />
				Game on Roblox: <a href="https://www.roblox.com/games/8019282661">https://www.roblox.com/games/8019282661</a>

				<br /><br />
				
				A <a href="https://www.roblox.com/games/4623386862">Piggy</a> clone made by following an <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLsbxI7NIoTtgnU5Wx8SLN0xTpKuRrSDFF">AlvinBlox tutorial</a>.

				Honestly, this game will probably be replaced with something else at some point since it is not really my game. For that same reason, this game will not be made open source since <a href="https://www.youtube.com/alvinblox">AlvinBlox</a> provides the finished product to those who pay membership to his YouTube channel, so I am pretty sure he would not want people distributing a complete version for free, even if it was created by following the free tutorial. Interestingly, the playlist is now unlisted, though I think it is fine for me to share the link here.
